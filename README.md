Python Code for Re-purposing Graphics Algorithms

#Inital aims of this project
Having taken part in pair programming, I now have a better idea of where I want to take this project for my individual work. I have choosen to do the contract of powerup and should aim to make 4 creative and varied functions with the genre of science fiction.

##Sci-fi
I intend to make this sci-fi through the choice of powerup (energy, health, potion, light) which should allow some user interaction with the program. This could also increase user engagement and an opportunity for creative flair.

#Update
So far in my code, the user is prompted to select between a health, energy, potion and light powerup. This choice is then named and remembered which picture has been choosen.

When the image is displayed on the canvas, it moves up while lightening the image and then down while darkening the image. Also, random stars positions are copied on the canvas.

The only import function so far is random which has been used for the stars and colour change.

Following functions:
-move image up and down
-make random stars
-make image lighter and darker
-random colour change of text
-user input of powerupchoice
-user input to choice another or exit
